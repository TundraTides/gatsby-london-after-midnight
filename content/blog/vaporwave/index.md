Modular audio synthesisers have been firmly routed in the audio world for many decades, with analog tools for making visual art developing closely in tandem, albeit at a much higher cost. In the 80's, digital tools arrived which largely pushed analog hardware to the backseat. In recent years analog video tools have made a comeback, with affordability creating accessibility due to companies like LZX Industries, who spearhead the development of these tools. 

Modular video works similarly to modular audio; the signal path begins with either a video input (pre-recorded video, video camera) or controlled voltage, which is then passed through a range of different modules via 3.5mm jack leads, manipulating shapes and colours before being displayed on screen, usually a CRT TV for the classic analog feel but also projectors and digital widescreens.

Due to it's analog nature, the brilliance and intensity of colours and shapes is often what draw artists to pursue building these systems, along with the creative freedom and exploration that the format offers. Many other analog tools are used alongside the modules such as CCTV cameras, video mixers and vector displays/oscilloscopes.
